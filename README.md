# etch-a-sketch

Etch a sketch on this colorful sketchpad! This is the [fourth project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) in
The Odin Project's 'Foundations' course. Major concepts I exercised and/or learned about include
flexbox, Javascript events, DOM/style manipulation, input validation, refactoring code, Git branches, and DevTools. 

The hardest parts of this project were getting grid layout to be consistently
the same size and dimensions, and the two extra credit assignments. The 
former required some relearning of flexbox styling, namely usage of the "flex" 
shorthand property to enlarge the cells and rows to take up the whole grid 
container. Implementing each of the two extra credits features required 
manipulating styling with Javascript and refactoring code to accomodate the new 
changes; even more so when ensuring that the two extra credit features were
compatible with each other! (Rainbow colors had to be generated only on the
first mouse-over, and the darkening gradient had to retain that assigned color.)

DevTools was very valuable in debugging: I set breakpoints, tracked values of variables, set nodes as global variables, and viewed computed styles. Regarding version control, considering how many features were in this project counting the extra credit features, using branches proved to be valuable. 

All in all, this project took me about 11 hours to relearn the concepts needed, implement a solution, and implement the extra credit features. About 2 hours to clean up, optimize, and request feedback. I'm also quite proud of my modular commit history in this one :)
